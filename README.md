## Goals

The goal of this project is to recommend images based on preferences of the user. We will build this system in three practical sessions.

We have to collect the following data.
1. A set of images.
2. Ask the user to select some images and add tags.
3. We analyse user created-tags and information (like image size, predominant colors) of available images to propose new images to the user.

## Init

- Download imageset from *https://www.kaggle.com/vishalsubbiah/pokemon-images-and-types*
